This is the Continuous Delivery plan for the deployed python application.

As seen in the repository, I included a 'Jenkinsfile' which would serve as the groovy pipeline script to build a DOcker image of the application, push it to the DockerHub Repository ready for deployment. I also included in the pipeline script a deployment step to Kubernetes cluster.

However, a continuous delivery plan would include:
1. A working GitHub repository (or any other version control manager like GitLab or BitBucket). This repository should have a webhook configured to trigger the build by Jenkins every time a new version of the code is pushed into it.
2. A continuous testing system set up after test cases have been written and pushed to the repository.
3. A Docker engine to build the containerized image each time a build is triggered.
4. A working DockerHub repository for the versions of containerised images. At this point, there could be a deployment to test environment from where the application is approved to go on to deployment to the production environment. When this is done, the next step follows.
5. An Ansible server on which the host servers have been configured. Once a build is completed by the CI/CD tool (Jenkins in this case), the next phase of delivery/deployment is triggered which releases the built image version to Ansible for onward deployment into the Kubernetes cluster(s) as necessary.

With this, it is ensured that there is a continuous delivery of the containerized application image, with no downtime.

Thank you for the opportunity to carry out this test.
